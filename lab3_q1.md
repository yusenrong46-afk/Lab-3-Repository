# Introduction to Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

**Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)** is a field of study that focuses on the design and use of computer technology, particularly the interactions between humans (users) and computers. HCI combines elements of **computer science, cognitive psychology, and design** to create interfaces that are intuitive and user-friendly.

### Core Concepts in HCI
1. **User-Centered Design (UCD):** A design process that focuses on the needs, preferences, and limitations of the end user.  
2. **Prototyping and Iteration:** Building early models (prototypes) and refining them based on user feedback.  
3. **Usability Metrics:** Evaluating how effectively and efficiently users can achieve their goals using an interface.

## Common Techniques in HCI

| Directive       | Purpose                                           | Example                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Wireframing     | Create a basic layout of an interface             | Sketching out a mobile app design |
| Usability Testing | Assess the ease of use for users                  | Running test sessions with participants |
| A/B Testing     | Compare two versions of a design to see which performs better | Testing two versions of a website |
